## Vision overview
We envision the future of latvian post as empowerment of both the client and the postman.

The client will be able to __share their google calendar as well as enable GPS tracking__ to let the delivery person know when to bring the package.

To ease and speed up deliveries the packages can be delivered by __gig workers__ who work when they have time and want to earn extra money. Using gig workers is enabled by the use of __tamper notifying bags__ which trigger an alarm and let the client know when the bag is opened or cut before disabling the alarm.
This also allows attaching these bags to the recipients mail box without compromising security.

The entire process will be well tracked using GPS trackers in the delivery vans to let the client know how far their package is.
